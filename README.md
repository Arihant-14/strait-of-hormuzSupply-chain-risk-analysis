Strait of Hormuz Supply Chain Risk Analysis
🔍 Project Overview
This project analyzes the strategic importance and associated risks of the Strait of Hormuz in global energy supply chains. Given the geopolitical volatility of the region, the study identifies potential supply chain disruptions and proposes viable alternative trade routes to ensure energy security and logistical resilience.

📌 Key Objectives
Assess the geopolitical and operational risks of maritime transport through the Strait of Hormuz.

Map critical supply chain dependencies on this chokepoint.

Quantify the economic impact of potential disruptions.

Propose and evaluate alternative trade routes (both maritime and overland).

Use data-driven analysis to support strategic logistics decision-making.

🧰 Tools & Methodologies
Data Analysis: Excel-based modeling and risk evaluation.

Geopolitical Risk Mapping: Identification of conflict zones, piracy threats, and sanctions.

Route Optimization: Comparative analysis of alternate maritime and land-based routes using time, cost, and security metrics.

🌍 Key Insights
Over 20% of global petroleum passes through the Strait of Hormuz, making it a high-risk, high-impact chokepoint.

Alternative routes such as Saudi land pipelines and UAE bypass ports offer strategic flexibility but at higher logistical and economic costs.

A diversified logistics strategy, incorporating redundancy and scenario planning, can reduce vulnerability to regional disruptions.
